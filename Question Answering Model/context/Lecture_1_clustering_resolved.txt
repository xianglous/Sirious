== History ==


=== Etymology === The_name_Berlin lies in northeastern_Germany , east of the River Elbe , that once constituted , together with the River ( Saxon or Thuringian ) Saale ( from Thuringian confluence at Barby onwards ) , the eastern border of the_Frankish_Realm . While the_Frankish_Realm was primarily inhabited by Germanic tribes like the Franks and the Saxons , the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by Slavic tribes . This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern_Germany bear Slavic - derived names ( Germania Slavica ) . Typical Germanized place name suffixes of Slavic origin are - ow , - itz , - vitz , - witz , - itzsch and - in , prefixes are Windisch and Wendisch . The_name_Berlin has The_name_Berlin roots in the language of West Slavic inhabitants of the area of today 's The_name_Berlin , and may be related to the Old Polabian stem berl - / birl - ( " swamp " ) . Since the Ber - at the beginning sounds like the German word Bär ( bear ) , a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city . It is therefore an example of canting arms . Of The_name_Berlin twelve boroughs , five bear a ( partly ) Slavic - derived name : Pankow ( the most populous ) , Steglitz - Zehlendorf , Marzahn - Hellersdorf , Treptow - Köpenick and Spandau ( named Spandow until 1878 ) . Of its ninety - six neighborhoods , twenty - two bear a ( partly ) Slavic - derived name : Altglienicke , Alt - Treptow , Britz , Buch , Buckow , Gatow , Karow , Kladow , Köpenick , Lankwitz , Lübars , Malchow , Marzahn , Pankow , Prenzlauer Berg , Rudow , Schmöckwitz , Spandau , Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow , Steglitz , Tegel and Zehlendorf . The neighborhood of Moabit bears a French - derived name , and Französisch Buchholz is named after the Huguenots .


=== 12th to 16th centuries === The earliest evidence of settlements in the area of today 's Berlin are remnants of a house foundation dated to 1174 , found in excavations in Berlin Mitte , and a wooden beam dated from approximately 1192 . The first written records of towns in the area of present - day Berlin date from the late 12th century . Spandau is first mentioned in these_areas in 1209 , although these_areas did not join Berlin until 1920 . The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns . Cölln on the Fischerinsel is first mentioned in a 1237 document , and Berlin , across the Spree in what is now called the Nikolaiviertel , is referenced in a document from 1244 . 1237 is considered the founding date of the_city . The two towns over time formed close economic and social ties , and profited from the staple right on the two important trade routes Via Imperii and from Bruges to Novgorod . In 1307 , they formed an alliance with a common external policy , they internal administrations still being separated.In 1415 , Frederick I became the elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg , which he ruled until 1440 . During the 15th century , he successors established Berlin - Cölln as capital of the margraviate , and subsequent members of the Hohenzollern family ruled in Berlin until 1918 , first as electors of Brandenburg , then as kings of Prussia , and eventually as German emperors . In 1443 , Frederick II Irontooth started the construction of a_new_royal_palace in the twin city Berlin_-_Cölln . The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448 , in the " Berlin Indignation " ( " Berliner Unwille " ) . This protest was not successful and the citizenry lost many of a_new_royal_palace political and economic privileges . After a_new_royal_palace was finished in 1451 , a_new_royal_palace gradually came into use . From 1470 , with the new elector Albrecht III Achilles , Berlin_-_Cölln became the new royal residence . Officially , the Berlin_-_Cölln palace became permanent residence of the_Brandenburg_electors_of_the_Hohenzollerns Brandenburg from 1486 , when John Cicero came to power .

In 1701 , the_very_far_-_flung_state formed the Kingdom of Prussia , as Frederick_III_,_Elector_of_Brandenburg_, crowned Frederick_III_,_Elector_of_Brandenburg_, as king Frederick I in Prussia . Berlin became the capital of the new Kingdom , replacing Königsberg . This was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the_very_far_-_flung_state , and it was the first time the_city began to grow . In 1709 , Berlin merged with the four cities of Cölln , Friedrichswerder , Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin , " Haupt - und Residenzstadt Berlin " . In 1740 , Frederick_II came to power . Under the rule of Frederick_II , Berlin became a center of the Enlightenment , but also , was briefly occupied during the Seven Years ' War by the Russian army .

The victorious powers divided the_city_'s into four sectors , analogous to the occupation zones into which Germany was divided . The sectors of the Western Allies ( the United States , the United Kingdom , and France ) formed West_Berlin , while the Soviet sector formed East_Berlin . All four Allies shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin . However , in 1948 , when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin , the Soviet Union imposed a blockade on the access routes to and from West_Berlin , which lay entirely inside Soviet - controlled territory . The Berlin airlift , conducted by the three western Allies , overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949 .

== Geography ==


=== Topography === Berlin is in northeastern Germany , in an area of low - lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat topography , part of the vast Northern European Plain which stretches all the way from northern France to western Russia . The Berliner Urstromtal ( an ice age glacial valley ) , between the low Barnim Plateau to the north and the_Teltow_Plateau , was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last Weichselian glaciation . The_Spree follows this valley now . In Spandau , a borough in the_west_of_Berlin Berlin , The_Spree empties into the river Havel , which flows from north to south through western Berlin . The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes , the largest being the Tegeler See and the Großer Wannsee . A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree , which flows through the Großer Müggelsee in eastern Berlin.Substantial parts of present - day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley . Large parts of the boroughs Reinickendorf and Pankow lie on the Barnim Plateau , while most of the boroughs of Charlottenburg - Wilmersdorf , Steglitz - Zehlendorf , Tempelhof - Schöneberg , and Neukölln lie on the_Teltow_Plateau . The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain , which stretches to the_west_of_Berlin Berlin . Since 2015 , the Arkenberge hills in Pankow at 122 meters ( 400 ft ) elevation , have been the highest point in Berlin . Through the disposal of construction debris they surpassed itself itself . The Müggelberge at 114.7 meters ( 376 ft ) elevation is the highest natural point and the lowest is the Spektesee in Spandau , at 28.1 meters ( 92 ft ) elevation .


=== Climate === Berlin has an oceanic climate ( Köppen : Cfb ) ; the eastern part of the city has a slight continental influence ( Dfb ) , especially in the 0 °C isotherm , one of the changes being the annual rainfall according to the air masses and the greater abundance during a period of the year . This type of climate features moderate summer temperatures but sometimes hot ( for being semicontinental ) and cold winters but not rigorous most of the time.Due to Berlin transitional climate zones , frosts are common in winter , and there are larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many oceanic climates . Furthermore , Berlin is classified as a temperate continental climate ( Dc ) under the Trewartha climate scheme , as well as the_suburbs_of_New_York , although the Köppen system puts the_suburbs_of_New_York in different types . Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of 22 – 25 °C ( 72 – 77 °F ) and lows of 12 – 14 °C ( 54 – 57 °F ) . Winters are cool with average high temperatures of 3 °C ( 37 °F ) and lows of −2 to 0 °C ( 28 to 32 °F ) . Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild . Berlin built - up area creates a microclimate , with heat stored by the_city buildings and pavement . Temperatures can be 4 °C ( 7 °F ) higher in the_city than in the surrounding areas . Annual precipitation is 570 millimeters ( 22 in ) with moderate rainfall throughout the year . Snowfall mainly occurs from December through March . The hottest month in Berlin was July 1834 , with a mean temperature of 23.0 °C ( 73.4 °F ) and the coldest was January 1709 , with a mean temperature of −13.2 °C ( 8.2 °F ) . The wettest month on record was July 1907 , with 230 millimeters ( 9.1 in ) of rainfall , whereas the driest were October 1866 , November 1902 , October 1908 and September 1928 , all with 1 millimeter ( 0.039 in ) of rainfall .
