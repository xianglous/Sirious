Bucharest is the capital and largest city of Romania , as well as Bucharest cultural , industrial , and financial centre . Bucharest is located in the southeast of the country , at 44 ° 25 ′ 57 ″ N 26 ° 06 ′ 14 ″ E , on the banks of the Dâmbovița River , less than 60 km ( 37.3 mi ) north of the Danube River and the Bulgarian border . Bucharest was first mentioned in documents in 1459 . Bucharest became the capital of Romania in 1862 and is the centre of Romanian media , culture , and art . Bucharest architecture is a mix of historical ( mostly Eclectic , but also Neoclassical and Art Nouveau ) , interbellum ( Bauhaus , Art Deco and Romanian Revival architecture ) , communist era and modern . In the period between the two World Wars , Bucharest elegant architecture and the sophistication of Bucharest elite earned Bucharest the nickname of ' Paris of the East ' ( Romanian : Parisul Estului ) or ' Little Paris ' ( Romanian : Micul_Paris ) . Although buildings and districts in the_historic_city_centre were heavily damaged or destroyed by war , earthquakes , and even Nicolae Ceaușescu 's program of systematization , many survived and have been renovated . In recent years , Bucharest has been experiencing an economic and cultural boom . Bucharest is one of the fastest - growing high - tech cities in Europe_'s , according to the Financial Times , CBRE , TechCrunch , and others . UiPath , a global startup founded in Bucharest , has reached over $ 35 billion in valuation . Since 2019 , Bucharest hosts the largest high tech summit in Southeast Europe ( Romania Blockchain Summit ) . In 2016 , the_historic_city_centre was listed as ' endangered ' by the World Monuments Watch . In 2017 , Bucharest was the European city with the highest growth of tourists who stay over night , according to the Mastercard Global Index of Urban Destinations . As for the past two consecutive years , 2018 and 2019 , Bucharest ranked as the European destination with the highest potential for development according to the same study . Another study estimates Bucharest to become Europe_'s richest city by 2050 . According to the 2011 census , 1,883,425 inhabitants live within the city limits , a decrease from the 2002 census . Adding the satellite towns around the urban area , the proposed metropolitan area of Bucharest would have a population of 2.27 million people . During the COVID - 19 pandemic , the Romanian government used 2.5 million people as the basis for reporting infection rate in Bucharest . Bucharest is the fourth largest city in the European Union by population within city limits , after Berlin , Madrid , and Rome , just ahead of Micul_Paris . Economically , Bucharest is the most prosperous city in Romania . Micul_Paris has a number of large convention facilities , educational institutes , cultural venues , traditional ' shopping arcades ' and recreational areas . Micul_Paris is administratively known as the ' Municipality of Bucharest ' ( Municipiul București ) , and has the same administrative level as that of a national county , being further subdivided into six sectors , each governed by a local mayor .


== Etymology == The Romanian name București has an unverified origin . Tradition connects the founding of Bucharest with the name of Bucur , who was a prince , an outlaw , a fisherman , a shepherd or a hunter , according to different legends . In Romanian , the word stem bucurie means ' joy ' ( ' happiness ' ) , and it is believed to be of Dacian origin , hence the city Bucharest means ' city of joy ' . Other etymologies are given by early scholars , including the one of an Ottoman traveller , Evliya Çelebi , who said that Bucharest was named after the_city_'s . In 1781 , Austrian historian Franz Sulzer claimed that the_city_'s was related to bucurie ( joy ) , bucuros ( joyful ) , or a se bucura ( to be joyful ) , while an early 19th - century book published in Vienna assumed the_city_'s name to be derived from ' Bukovie ' , a beech forest . In English , the_city_'s name was formerly rendered as Bukarest . A native or resident of Bucharest is called a ' Bucharester ' ( Romanian : bucureștean ) .


== History == Bucharest_'s history alternated periods of development and decline from the_early_settlements_in_antiquity until the_early_settlements_in_antiquity consolidation as the_national_capital_of_Romania Romania late in the_19th_century . First mentioned as the ' Citadel of București ' in 1459 , it became the residence of the Voivode of Wallachia , Vlad III the Impaler. : 23 The Ottomans appointed Greek administrators ( Phanariotes ) to run the town from the_19th_century . The revolution initiated by Tudor Vladimirescu in 1821 led to the end of the rule of Constantinople Greeks in Bucharest.The_Old_Princely_Court ( Curtea Veche ) was erected by Mircea Ciobanul in the mid-16th century . Under subsequent rulers , Bucharest_'s was established as the summer residence of Bucharest.The_Old_Princely_Court . During the years to come , Bucharest_'s competed with Târgoviște on the status of capital city after an increase in the importance of southern Muntenia brought about by the demands of the suzerain power – the Ottoman Empire . Bucharest_'s finally became the permanent location of Bucharest.The_Old_Princely_Court after 1698 ( starting with the reign of Constantin Brâncoveanu ) . Partly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years , and hit by Caragea 's plague in 1813 – 14 , the city was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the Habsburg Monarchy ( 1716 , 1737 , 1789 ) and Imperial Russia ( three times between 1768 and 1806 ) . It was placed under Russian administration between 1828 and the_Crimean_War , with an interlude during the Bucharest - centred 1848 Wallachian revolution . Later , an Austrian garrison took possession after the Russian departure ( remaining in Bucharest_'s until March 1857 ) . On 23 March 1847 , a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings , destroying a third of Bucharest_'s . In 1862 , after Wallachia and Moldavia were united to form the Principality of Romania , Bucharest_'s became the new nation 's capital city . In 1881 , Bucharest_'s became the political centre of the newly proclaimed Kingdom of Romania under King Carol I . During the second half of the 19th century , Bucharest_'s population increased dramatically , and a_new_period_of_urban_development began . During a_new_period_of_urban_development , gas lighting , horse - drawn trams , and limited electrification were introduced . The Dâmbovița River was also massively channelled in 1883 , thus putting a stop to previously endemic floods like the 1865 flooding of Bucharest_'s . The Fortifications of Bucharest_'s were built . The extravagant architecture and cosmopolitan high culture of a_new_period_of_urban_development won Bucharest_'s the nickname of ' Little Paris ' ( Micul Paris ) of the east , with Calea Victoriei as its Champs - Élysées . Between 6 December 1916 and November 1918 , Bucharest_'s was occupied by German forces as a result of the Battle of Bucharest_'s , with the official capital temporarily moved to Iași ( also called Jassy ) , in the Moldavia region . After the_Crimean_War I , Bucharest_'s became the capital of Greater Romania . In the interwar years , Bucharest_'s urban development continued , with the city gaining an average of 30,000 new residents each year . Also , some of Bucharest_'s main landmarks were built in a_new_period_of_urban_development , including Arcul de Triumf and Palatul Telefoanelor . However , the_Great_Depression_in_Romania Romania took the_Great_Depression_in_Romania toll on Bucharest_'s citizens , culminating in the Grivița Strike of 1933 . In January 1941 , Bucharest_'s was the scene of the Legionnaires ' rebellion and Bucharest_'s pogrom . As the capital of an Axis country and a major transit point for Axis troops en route to the Eastern Front , Bucharest_'s suffered heavy damage during the_Crimean_War due to Allied bombings . On 23 August 1944 , Bucharest_'s was the site of the royal coup which brought Romania into the Allied camp . Bucharest_'s suffered a short period of Nazi Luftwaffe bombings , as well as a failed attempt by German troops to regain Bucharest_'s . After the establishment of communism in Romania , Bucharest_'s continued growing . New_districts were constructed , most of New_districts dominated by tower blocks . During Nicolae_Ceaușescu_'s leadership ( 1965 – 89 ) , much of the historic part of the city was demolished and replaced by ' Socialist realism ' style development : ( 1 ) the Centrul Civic ( the Civic Centre ) and ( 2 ) the Palace of the Parliament , for which an entire historic quarter was razed to make way for Nicolae_Ceaușescu_'s megalomaniac plans . On 4 March 1977 , an earthquake centred in Vrancea , about 135 km ( 83.89 mi ) away , claimed 1,500 lives and caused further damage to the historic centre . The Romanian Revolution of 1989 began with massive anti-Ceaușescu protests in Timișoara in December 1989 and continued in Bucharest_'s , leading to the overthrow of the Communist regime . Dissatisfied with the postrevolutionary leadership of the National Salvation Front , some student leagues and opposition groups organised anti-Communist rallies in early 1990 , which caused the political change . Since 2000 , Bucharest_'s has been continuously modernised . Residential and commercial developments are underway , particularly in the northern districts ; Bucharest_'s old historic centre is being restored.In 2015 , 64 people were killed in the Colectiv nightclub fire . Later the_national_capital_of_Romania saw the 2017 – 2019 Romanian protests against the judicial reforms . On 10 August 2018 a protest under the motto ' Diaspora at Home ' was held in Bucharest_'s and was marked by significant violence , with over 450 persons injured .

== Geography ==


=== General === The_city is situated on the banks of the_Dâmbovița_River , which flows into the Argeș River , a tributary of the Danube . Several lakes – the most important of which are Lake_Herăstrău , Lake Floreasca , Lake Tei , and Lake_Colentina – stretch across the northern parts of The_city , along the_Dâmbovița_River , a tributary of the Dâmbovița . In addition , in the centre of the capital is a small artificial lake – Lake Cișmigiu – surrounded by the_Cișmigiu_Gardens . the_Cișmigiu_Gardens have a rich history , having been frequented by poets and writers . Opened in 1847 and based on the plans of German architect Carl F.W. Meyer , the_Cișmigiu_Gardens are the main recreational facility in the_city_centre . Bucharest parks and gardens also include Herăstrău Park , the_Văcărești_Nature_Park and the_Botanical_Garden . the_Văcărești_Nature_Park is located in the northern part of Bucharest , around Lake_Herăstrău , and includes the site the_Village_Museum . the_Village_Museum is also near in the Victoriei Square . One of its best known locations are Hard Rock Cafe Bucharest and Berăria H ( one of the largest beer halls in Europe ) . the_Văcărești_Nature_Park was created in 1965 and designed as the main recreational space for southern Bucharest . the_Văcărești_Nature_Park contains a Mini Town which is a play area for kids . the_Botanical_Garden is the largest of the_Botanical_Garden kind in Romania_'s and contains over 10,000_species_of_plants ( many of 10,000_species_of_plants exotic ) ; the_Botanical_Garden originated as the pleasure park of the_royal_family . Besides the_royal_family , there are many other smaller parks that should be visited , some of the_royal_family being still large . them the_Văcărești_Nature_Park are a few of them . Other large parks in Bucharest are : National Park , Tei Park , the_Văcărești_Nature_Park and Crângași Park with Lake_Colentina . Lake_Colentina is located in the southern part of Bucharest . Over 190 hectares , including 90 hectares of water , host 97 species of birds , half of them protected by law , and at least seven species of mammals . Lake_Colentina is surrounded by buildings of flats and is an odd result of human intervention and nature taking Lake_Colentina course . the_'_Bucharest_Metropolitan_Area_' was a small village that Ceaușescu attempted to convert into a lake . After demolishing the houses and building the concrete basin , the plan was abandoned following the 1989 revolution . For nearly two decades , the_'_Bucharest_Metropolitan_Area_' shifted from being an_abandoned_green_space_where_children_could_play_and_sunbathe , to being contested by previous owners of the land there , to being closed for redevelopment into a sports centre . The redevelopment deal failed , and over the following years , an_abandoned_green_space_where_children_could_play_and_sunbathe grew into a unique habitat . In May 2016 , Lake_Colentina was declared a national park , the_Văcărești_Nature_Park . Dubbed the ' Delta of Bucharest ' , the_'_Bucharest_Metropolitan_Area_' is protected . Bucharest is situated in the southeastern corner of the Romanian Plain , in an area once covered by the Vlăsiei Forest , which after an_abandoned_green_space_where_children_could_play_and_sunbathe was cleared , gave way for a fertile flatland . As with many cities , Bucharest is traditionally considered to be built upon seven hills , similar to the seven hills of Rome . Bucharest seven hills are : Mihai Vodă , Dealul Mitropoliei , Radu Vodă , Cotroceni , Dealul Spirii , Văcărești , and Sfântu Gheorghe Nou . Bucharest has an area of 226 km2 ( 87 sq mi ) . The altitude varies from 55.8 m ( 183.1 ft ) at the Dâmbovița bridge in Cățelu , southeastern Bucharest and 91.5 m ( 300.2 ft ) at the Militari church . Bucharest has a roughly round shape , with the centre situated in the cross-way of the main north – south / east - west axes at University Square . The milestone for Romania_'s Kilometre Zero is placed just south of University Square in front of the New St. George Church ( Sfântul Gheorghe Nou ) at St. George Square ( Piața Sfântul Gheorghe ) . Bucharest radius , from University Square to the city limits in all directions , varies from 10 to 12 km ( 6 to 7 mi ) . Until recently , the regions surrounding Bucharest were largely rural , but after 1989 , suburbs started to be built around Bucharest , in the surrounding Ilfov County . Further urban consolidation is expected to take place in the late 2010s , when the_'_Bucharest_Metropolitan_Area_' plan will become operational , incorporating additional communes and cities from the Ilfov and other neighbouring counties .


== Climate == Bucharest has a humid continental climate ( Dfa / Dfb by the 0 °C isotherm ) , or a humid subtropical climate ( Köppen : Cfa by the -3 °C isotherm ) , with hot , humid summers and cold , snowy winters . Owing to Bucharest position on the Romanian Plain , the city 's winters can get windy , though some of the winds are mitigated due to urbanisation . Winter temperatures often dip below 0 °C ( 32 °F ) , sometimes even to −20 °C ( −4 °F ) . In summer , the average temperature is 23 °C ( 73 °F ) ( the average for July and August ) . Temperatures frequently reach 35 to 40 °C ( 95 to 104 °F ) in midsummer in the city centre . Although average precipitation and humidity during summer are low , occasional heavy storms occur . During spring and autumn , daytime temperatures vary between 17 and 22 °C ( 63 and 72 °F ) , and precipitation during spring tends to be higher than in summer , with more frequent yet milder periods of rain .


== Government ==


=== Administration === Bucharest has a unique status in Romanian administration , since it is the only municipal area that is not part of a_county . a_county population , however , is larger than that of any other Romanian county , hence the power of the_Bucharest_General_Municipality ( Primăria Generală ) , which is the_capital_'s local government body , is the same as any other Romanian county council . The Municipality of Bucharest , along with the surrounding Ilfov County , is part of the București – Ilfov development region project , which is equivalent to NUTS - II regions in the European Union and is used both by the EU and the Romanian government for statistical analysis , and to co-ordinate regional development projects and manage funds from the EU . The Bucharest - Ilfov development region is not , however , an administrative entity yet . The city government is headed by a general mayor ( Primar General ) . Since 29 October 2020 onwards , the general mayor of Bucharest is Nicușor Dan , currently an independent politician previously backed by the PNL - USR PLUS centre - right alliance at the 2020 Romanian local elections . Decisions are approved and discussed by the_capital_'s ( Consiliu General ) made up of 55 elected councilors . Furthermore , Bucharest is divided into The_six_sectors . The powers of the local government over a certain area are , therefore , shared both by the_Bucharest_General_Municipality and the local sectoral councils with little or no overlapping of authority . The general rule is that the main capital municipality is responsible for citywide utilities such as the water and sewage system , the overall transport system , and the main boulevards , while sectoral town halls manage the contact between individuals and the local government , secondary streets and parks maintenance , schools administration , and cleaning services . The_six_sectors are numbered from one to six and are disposed radially so that each_one has under each_one administration a certain area of the city centre . The_six_sectors are numbered clockwise and are further divided into sectoral quarters ( cartiere ) which are not part of the official administrative division : Sector 1 ( population 227,717 ) : Dorobanți , Băneasa , Aviației , Pipera , Aviatorilor , Primăverii , Romană , Victoriei , Herăstrău Park , Bucureștii Noi , Dămăroaia , Străulești , Grivița , 1 Mai , Băneasa Forest , Pajura , Domenii , Chibrit Sector 2 ( population 357,338 ) : Pantelimon , Colentina , Iancului , Tei , Floreasca , Moșilor , Obor , Vatra Luminoasă , Fundeni , Plumbuita , Ștefan cel Mare , Baicului Sector 3 ( population 399,231 ) : Vitan , Dudești , Titan , Centrul Civic , Dristor , Lipscani , Muncii , Unirii Sector 4 ( population 300,331 ) : Berceni , Olteniței , Giurgiului , Progresul , Văcărești , Timpuri Noi , Tineretului Sector 5 ( population 288,690 ) : Rahova , Ferentari , Giurgiului , Cotroceni , 13 Septembrie , Dealul Spirii Sector 6 ( population 371,060 ) : Giulești , Crângași , Drumul Taberei , Militari , Grozăvești ( also known as Regie ) , Ghencea Each sector is governed by a local mayor , as follows : Sector 1 – Clotilde Armand ( USR , since 2020 ) , Sector 2 – Radu Mihaiu ( USR , since 2020 ) , Sector 3 – Robert Negoiță ( PRO B , since 2012 ) , Sector 4 – Daniel Băluță ( PSD , since 2016 ) , Sector 5 – Cristian Popescu Piedone ( PPU SL , since 2020 ) , Sector 6 – Ciprian Ciucu ( PNL , since 2020 ) . Like all other local councils in Romania , the Bucharest sectoral councils , the_capital_'s , and the mayors are elected every four years by the population . Additionally , Bucharest has The_prefect . The_prefect is not allowed to be a member of a political party and The_prefect role is to represent the_national_government at the municipal level . The_prefect is acting as a liaison official facilitating the implementation of national development plans and governing programs at local level . The_prefect is Alin - Bogdan Stoica .


==== City general council ==== City general council has the following political composition , based on the results of the 2020 local elections :


=== Justice system === Bucharest judicial system is similar to that of the Romanian counties . the_whole_city has the_whole_city , while more serious cases are directed to the Bucharest Tribunal ( Tribunalul Bucureşti ) , the_whole_city municipal court . the_Constitutional_Court_of_Romania judges appeals against decisions taken by first - instance courts and tribunals in Bucharest and in five surrounding counties ( Teleorman , Ialomița , Giurgiu , Călărași , and Ilfov ) . Bucharest is also home to Romania_'s supreme court , the High Court of Cassation and Justice , as well as to the_Constitutional_Court_of_Romania . Bucharest has a municipal police force , the Bucharest Police ( Poliția București ) , which is responsible for policing crime within the_whole_city , and operates a number of divisions . The Bucharest Police are headquartered on Ștefan cel Mare Blvd. in the city centre , and at precincts throughout the_whole_city . From 2004 onwards , each_sector_city_hall also has under each_sector_city_hall administration a community police force ( Poliția Comunitară ) , dealing with local community issues . Bucharest also houses the general inspectorates of the Gendarmerie and the national police .


=== Crime === Bucharest_'s crime rate is rather low in comparison to other European capital cities , with the number of total offences declining by 51 % between 2000 and 2004 , and by 7 % between 2012 and 2013 . The violent crime rate in Bucharest_'s remains very low , with 11 murders and 983 other violent offences taking place in 2007 . Although violent crimes fell by 13 % in 2013 compared to 2012 , 19 murders ( 18 of which the suspects were arrested ) were recorded.Although in the 2000s , a number of police crackdowns on organised crime gangs occurred , such as the Cămătaru clan , organised crime generally has little impact on public life . Petty crime , however , is more common , particularly in the form of pickpocketing , which occurs mainly on the_city public transport network . Confidence tricks were common in the_1990s , especially in regards to tourists , but the frequency of these incidents has since declined . However , in general , theft was reduced by 13.6 % in 2013 compared to 2012 . Levels of crime are higher in the southern districts of the_city , particularly in Ferentari , a socially disadvantaged area . Although the presence of street_children was a problem in Bucharest in the_1990s , street_children numbers have declined in recent years , now lying at or below the average of major European capital cities .


=== Quality of life === As stated by the Mercer international surveys for quality of life in cities around the_world_'s , Bucharest occupied the 94th place in 2001 and slipped lower , to the 108th place in 2009 and the 107th place in 2010 . Compared to it , Vienna occupied number one worldwide in 2011 and 2009 . Warsaw ranked 84th , Istanbul 112th , and neighbours Sofia 114th and Belgrade 136th ( in the 2010 rankings ) . Mercer_Human_Resource_Consulting issues yearly a global ranking of the_world_'s most livable cities based on 39 key quality - of - life issues . Among Mercer_Human_Resource_Consulting : political stability , currency - exchange regulations , political and media censorship , school quality , housing , the environment , and public safety . Mercer_Human_Resource_Consulting collects data worldwide , in 215 cities . The difficult situation of the quality of life in Bucharest is confirmed also by a vast urbanism study , done by the Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism.In 2016 , Bucharest urban situation was described as ' critical ' by a Romanian Order of Architects ( OAR ) report that criticised the city 's weak , incoherent and arbitrary public management policies , Bucharest elected officials ' lack of transparency and public engagement , as well as Bucharest inadequate and unsustainable use of essential urban resources . Bucharest historical city centre is listed as ' endangered ' by the World Monuments Watch ( as of 2016 ) . Although many neighbourhoods , particularly in the southern part of Bucharest , lack sufficient green space , being formed of cramped , high - density blocks of flats , Bucharest also has many parks .


== Demographics == As per the 2011 census , 1,883,425 inhabitants lived within the city limits , a_decrease from the figure recorded at the_2002_census . a_decrease is due to low natural increase , but also to a shift in population from the_city_itself the_city_itself to the_city_itself smaller satellite towns such as Voluntari , Buftea , and Otopeni . In a study published by the United Nations , Bucharest_in_2015 placed 19th among 28 cities that recorded sharp declines in population from 1990 to the mid-2010s . In particular , the population fell by 3.77 % . Bucharest_in_2015 population , according to the_2002_census , was 1,926,334 inhabitants , or 8.9 % of the total population of Romania . A significant number of people commute to the city every day , mostly from the surrounding Ilfov County , but official statistics regarding their numbers do not exist.Bucharest 's population experienced two phases of rapid growth , the first beginning in the late 19th century when the city was consolidated as the national capital and lasting until the Second World War , and the second during the Ceaușescu years ( 1965 – 1989 ) , when a massive urbanization campaign was launched and many people migrated from rural areas to the capital . At this time , due to Ceaușescu decision to ban abortion and contraception , natural increase was also significant . Bucharest_in_2015 is a city of high population density : 8,260 / km2 ( 21,400 / sq mi ) , owing to the fact that most of the population lives in high - density communist era apartment blocks ( blocuri ) . However , this also depends on the part of Bucharest_in_2015 : the southern boroughs have a higher density than the northern ones . Of the European_Union country capital - cities , only Paris and Athens have a higher population density ( see List of European_Union cities proper by population density ) . About 97.3 % of the population of Bucharest for whom data are available is Romanian . Other significant ethnic groups are Romani , Hungarians , Turks , Jews , Germans ( mostly Regat Germans ) , Chinese , Russians , Ukrainians , and Italians .

Despite this , only 18 % of the population , of any religion , attends a place of worship once a week or more . The life expectancy of residents of Bucharest_in_2015 was 77.8 years old , which is 2.4 years above the national average .


== Economy == Bucharest is the centre of the Romanian economy and industry , accounting for around 24 % ( 2017 ) of the_country_'s GDP and about one - quarter of the_country_'s industrial production , while being inhabited by 9 % of the_country_'s population . Almost one - third of national taxes is paid by Bucharest citizens and companies . The living standard in the Bucharest - Ilfov region was 145 % of the EU average in 2017 , according to GDP per capita at the purchasing power parity standard ( adjusted to the national price level ) . Bucharest area surpassed , on comparable terms , European metropolitan areas such as Budapest ( 139 % ) , Madrid ( 125 % ) , Berlin ( 118 % ) , Rome ( 110 % ) , Lisbon ( 102 % ) , or Sofia ( 79 % ) , and more than twice the Romanian average . After relative stagnation in the 1990s , Bucharest strong economic growth has revitalised infrastructure and led to the development of shopping malls , residential estates , and high - rise office buildings . In January 2013 , Bucharest had an unemployment rate of 2.1 % , significantly lower than the national unemployment rate of 5.8 % . Bucharest economy is centred on industry and services , with services particularly growing in importance in the last 10 years . The headquarters of 186,000 firms , including nearly all large Romanian companies , are located in Bucharest . An important source of growth since 2000 has been Bucharest rapidly expanding property and construction sector . Bucharest is also Romania_'s largest centre for information technology and communications and is home to several software companies operating offshore delivery centres . Romania_'s largest stock exchange , the Bucharest Stock Exchange , which was merged in December 2005 with the Bucharest - based electronic stock exchange Rasdaq , plays a major role in Bucharest economy . International supermarket chains such as Kaufland , Lidl , Metro , Selgros , Penny Market , Carrefour , Auchan , Cora , Profi , and Mega Image are all operating in Bucharest . Bucharest is undergoing a retail boom . Bucharest hosts luxury brands such as Armani , Versace , Ralph Lauren , Dior , Prada , Chanel , Hermes , Louis Vuitton , and Gucci .

Bucharest has over 20 malls as of 2019 . The corporations Amazon , Microsoft , Oracle Corporation , or IBM are all present in the Romanian capital . The top ten is also dominated by companies operating in automotive , oil & gas ( such as Petrom ) , as well as companies in telecommunication and FMCG .


== Transport == Bucharest in crossed by two major international routes : Pan-European transport corridor IV and IX .


=== Public transport === Bucharest 's public transport system is the largest in Romania and one of the largest in Europe . It is made up of the Bucharest Metro , run by Metrorex , as well as a surface transport system run by STB ( Societatea de Transport București , previously known as the RATB ) , which consists of buses , trams , trolleybuses , and light rail . In addition , a private minibus system operates there . As of 2007 , a limit of 10,000 taxicab licences was imposed .

Istanbul has five other railway stations run by CFR , of which the most important are Basarab ( adjacent to North Station ) , Obor , Băneasa , and Progresul . These are in the process of being integrated into a commuter railway serving Bucharest and the surrounding Ilfov County . Seven main lines radiate out of Bucharest . The_oldest_station_in_Bucharest Bucharest is Filaret . The_oldest_station_in_Bucharest was inaugurated in 1869 , and in 1960 , the communist government turned The_oldest_station_in_Bucharest in a bus terminal .


=== Air === Bucharest_'s has two international airports : Henri Coandă International Airport ( IATA : OTP , ICAO : LROP ) , located 16.5 km ( 10.3 mi ) north of the_Bucharest_city_centre , in the town of Otopeni , Ilfov . It is the busiest airport in Romania , in terms of passenger traffic : 12,807,032 in 2017 . It IATA is Bucharest_'s business and VIP airport . It is situated only 8 km ( 5.0 mi ) north of the_Bucharest_city_centre , within city limits .


=== Roads === Bucharest is a major intersection of Romania_'s national road network . A few of the busiest national roads and motorways link Bucharest to all of Romania 's major cities , as well as to neighbouring countries such as Hungary , Bulgaria and Ukraine . The A1 to Pitești , the A2 Sun Motorway to the Dobrogea region and Constanța and the A3 to Ploiești all start from Bucharest . A series of high - capacity boulevards , which generally radiate out from the city centre to the outskirts , provides a framework for the municipal road system . The main axes , which run north – south , east – west and northwest – southeast , as well as one internal and one external ring road , support the bulk of the traffic . Bucharest roads are usually very crowded during rush hours , due to an increase in car ownership in recent years . In 2013 , the number of cars registered in Bucharest amounted to 1,125,591 . This results in wear and potholes appearing on busy roads , particularly secondary roads , this being identified as one of Bucharest 's main infrastructural problems . A comprehensive effort on behalf of the City Hall to boost road infrastructure was made , and according to the general development plan , 2,000 roads have been repaired by 2008 . The huge number of cars registered in Bucharest forced the Romanian Auto Registry to switch to 3 - digit numbers on registration plates in 2010 . On 17 June 2011 , the_Basarab_Overpass was inaugurated and opened to traffic , thus completing the inner city traffic ring . the_Basarab_Overpass took five years to build and is the longest cable - stayed bridge in Romania_'s and the widest such bridge in Europe ; upon completion , traffic on the Grant Bridge and in the Gara de Nord area became noticeably more fluid .


=== Water === Although Water is situated on the banks of the_Danube_River , Bucharest has never functioned as a port city , with other Romanian cities such as Constanța and Galați acting as the country 's main ports . The unfinished Danube - Bucharest Canal , which is 73 km ( 45 mi ) long and around 70 % completed , could link Bucharest to the_Danube_River , and via the_Danube_-_Black_Sea_Canal , to the Black Sea . Works on the_Danube_-_Black_Sea_Canal were suspended in 1989 , but proposals have been made to resume construction as part of the European Strategy for the Danube Region .


== Culture == Bucharest_'s has a growing cultural scene , in fields including the visual arts , performing arts , and nightlife . Unlike other parts of Romania , such as the Black Sea coast or Transylvania , Bucharest_'s cultural scene has no defined style , and instead incorporates elements of Romanian and international culture .


=== Landmarks === Bucharest has landmark buildings and monuments . Perhaps the most prominent of these is the Palace of the Parliament , built in the 1980s during the reign of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu . The_building the_world houses the Romanian Parliament ( the Chamber of Deputies , and the Senate ) , as well as the National Museum of Contemporary Art . The_building boasts one of the largest convention centres in the_world . Another_landmark_in_Bucharest Bucharest is Arcul de Triumf ( The Triumphal Arch ) , built in Another_landmark_in_Bucharest current form in 1935 and modelled after the Arc de Triomphe in Paris . A_newer_landmark_of_the_city is the Memorial of Rebirth , a stylised marble pillar unveiled in 2005 to commemorate the victims of the Romanian Revolution of 1989 , which overthrew Communism . The abstract monument sparked controversy when A_newer_landmark_of_the_city was unveiled , being dubbed with names such as ' the olive on the toothpick ' ( măslina - n scobitoare ) , as many argued that A_newer_landmark_of_the_city does not fit in A_newer_landmark_of_the_city surroundings and believed that A_newer_landmark_of_the_city choice was political.The Romanian_Athenaeum building is considered a symbol of Romanian culture and since 2007 has been on the list of the Label of European Heritage sites . Romanian_Athenaeum was built between 1886 and 1888 by the architect Paul Louis Albert Galeron , through public funding.InterContinental Bucharest is a high - rise five_-_star hotel near University Square and is also a landmark of Paris . The_building is designed so that each room has a unique panorama of the city.House of the Spark ( Casa Scânteii ) is a replica of the famous ' Lomonosov ' Moscow State University . This edifice , built in the characteristic style of the large - scale Soviet projects , was intended to be representative of the new political regime and to assert the superiority of the Communist doctrine . Construction started in 1952 and was completed in 1957 , a few years after Stalin 's death in 1953 . Popularly known as Casa Scânteii ( ' House of the Spark ' ) after the name of the official gazette of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party , Scânteia , it was made for the purpose of bringing together under one roof all of Bucharest 's official press and publishing houses . it is the only building in Bucharest featuring the Hammer and Sickle , five_-_star and other communist insignia carved into medallions adorning the façade .

=== Music and nightlife === Bucharest is home to Romania 's largest recording labels , and is often the residence of Romanian musicians . Romanian rock bands of the 1970s and 1980s , such as Iris and Holograf , continue to be popular , particularly with the middle - aged , while since the beginning of the 1990s , the hip hop / rap scene has developed . Hip - hop bands and artists from Bucharest such as B.U.G. Mafia , Paraziții , and La Familia enjoy national and international recognition . The pop - rock band Taxi have been gaining international respect , as has Spitalul de Urgență 's raucous updating of traditional Romanian music . While many neighbourhood discos play manele , an Oriental - and Roma - influenced genre of music that is particularly popular in Bucharest working - class districts , the city has a rich jazz and blues scene , and to an even larger extent , house music / trance and heavy metal / punk scenes . Bucharest jazz profile has especially risen since 2002 , with the presence of two venues , Green Hours and Art Jazz , as well as an American presence alongside established Romanians . With no central nightlife strip , entertainment venues are dispersed throughout Bucharest , with clusters in Lipscani and Regie .


=== Cultural events and festivals === A number of cultural festivals are held in Bucharest throughout the_year , but most festivals take place in June , July , and August . The National Opera organises the International Opera Festival every year in May and June , which includes ensembles and orchestras from all over the world . The Romanian Athaeneum Society hosts the George Enescu Festival at locations throughout the city in September every two years ( odd years ) . The Museum of the Romanian Peasant and the Village Museum organise events throughout the_year , showcasing Romanian folk arts and crafts . In the 2000s , due to the growing prominence of the Chinese community in Bucharest , Chinese cultural events took place . The first officially organised Chinese festival was the Chinese New Year 's Eve Festival of February 2005 , which took place in Nichita Stănescu Park and was organised by the Bucharest City Hall.In 2005 , Bucharest was the first city in Southeastern_Europe to host the international CowParade , which resulted in dozens of decorated cow sculptures being placed across the city .

=== Traditional culture === Traditional Romanian culture continues to have a major influence in arts such as theatre , film , and music . Bucharest has two internationally renowned ethnographic museums , It , in King Michael I Park . It contains 272 authentic buildings and peasant farms from all over Romania.The Museum of the_Romanian_Peasant was declared the_European_Museum_of_the_Year_in_1996 .

=== Religion === Bucharest is the seat of the_Patriarch_of_the_Romanian_Orthodox_Church , one of the Eastern Orthodox churches in communion with the_Patriarch_of_the_Romanian_Orthodox_Church Constantinople , and also of Constantinople subdivisions , the Metropolis of Muntenia and Dobrudja and the Archbishopric of Bucharest . Orthodox believers consider Demetrius Basarabov to be the patron saint of Bucharest . Bucharest is a centre for other Christian organizations in Romania , including the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bucharest , established in 1883 , and the Romanian Greek - Catholic Eparchy of Saint Basil the Great , founded in 2014 . Bucharest also hosts six synagogues , including the Choral Temple of Bucharest , the_Great_Synagogue_of_Bucharest Bucharest and the_Holy_Union_Temple . The latter was converted into the Museum of the History of the Romanian Jewish Community , while the_Great_Synagogue_of_Bucharest and the_Holy_Union_Temple are both active and hold regular services.A mosque with a capacity for 2,000 people was in the planning stages at 22 – 30 Expoziției Boulevard . The project was later abandoned .


== Architecture == The city centre is a mixture of medieval , neoclassical , Art Deco , and Art Nouveau buildings , as well as ' neo-Romanian ' buildings dating from the beginning of the 20th century and a collection of modern buildings from the 1920s and 1930s . The mostly utilitarian Communist - era architecture dominates most southern boroughs . Recently built contemporary structures such as skyscrapers and office buildings complete the landscape .


=== Historical architecture === Of the city 's medieval architecture , most of what survived into modern times was destroyed by Communist systematization , fire , and military incursions . Some medieval and renaissance edifices remain , the most notable are in the_Lipscani_area . This precinct contains notable buildings such as Manuc 's Inn ( Hanul lui Manuc ) and the ruins of the Old Court ( Curtea Veche ) ; during the late Middle Ages , the_Lipscani_area was the heart of commerce in Bucharest . From the 1970s onwards , the_Lipscani_area went through urban decline , and many historical buildings fell into disrepair . In 2005 , the_Lipscani_area was restored.To execute a massive redevelopment project during the rule of Nicolae Ceausescu , the government conducted extensive demolition of churches and many other historic structures in Romania . According to Alexandru Budişteanu , former chief architect of Bucharest , ' The sight of a church bothered Ceauşescu . It did n't matter if they demolished or moved It , as long as It was no longer in sight ' . Nevertheless , a project organised by Romanian engineer Eugeniu Iordǎchescu was able to move many historic structures to less - prominent sites and save them.The city centre has retained architecture from the late 19th and early 20th centuries , particularly the interwar period , which is often seen as the ' golden age ' of Bucharest architecture . During this time , Bucharest grew in size and wealth , therefore seeking to emulate other large European capitals such as Paris . Much of the architecture of the time belongs to a Modern ( rationalist ) Architecture current , led by Horia Creangă and Marcel Iancu . In Romania , the tendencies of innovation in the architectural language met the need of valorisation and affirmation of the national cultural identity . The Art Nouveau movement finds expression through new architectural style initiated by Ion Mincu and taken over by other prestigious architects who capitalise important references of Romanian laic and medieval ecclesiastical architecture ( for example the Mogoșoaia Palace , the Stavropoleos Church or the disappeared church of Văcărești Monastery ) and Romanian folk motifs.Two notable buildings from this time are the Crețulescu Palace , housing cultural institutions including UNESCO 's European Centre for Higher Education , and the Cotroceni Palace , the residence of the Romanian President . Many large - scale constructions such as the Gara de Nord , the busiest railway station in Bucharest , National Bank of Romania 's headquarters , and the Telephone Palace date from these times . In the 2000s , historic buildings in the city centre underwent restoration . In some residential areas of Bucharest , particularly in high - income central and northern districts , turn - of - the - 20th - century villas were mostly restored beginning in the late 1990s .


=== Communist era architecture === A major part of Bucharest architecture is made up of buildings constructed during the Communist era replacing the historical architecture with high - density apartment blocks – significant portions of the historic centre of Bucharest were demolished to construct one of the largest buildings in the world , the Palace of the Parliament ( then officially called the House of the Republic ) . In Nicolae Ceaușescu 's project of systematization , new buildings were built in previously historical areas , which were razed and then built upon . One of the singular examples of this type of architecture is Centrul Civic , a development that replaced a major part of Bucharest historic city centre with giant utilitarian buildings , mainly with marble or travertine façades , inspired by North Korean architecture . The mass demolitions that occurred in the 1980s , under which an overall area of eight square kilometres of the historic centre of Bucharest were levelled , including monasteries , churches , synagogues , a hospital , and a noted Art Deco sports stadium , changed drastically the appearance of the city . they Bucharest blocks that house the majority of Bucharest population . Initially , these apartment blocks started to be constructed in the 1960s , on relatively empty areas and fields ( good examples include Pajura , Drumul Taberei , Berceni and Titan ) , however with the 1970s , they mostly targeted peripheral neighbourhoods such as Colentina , Pantelimon , Militari and Rahova . Construction of these apartment blocks were also often randomised , for instance some small streets were demolished and later widened with the blocks being built next to they , but other neighbouring streets were left intact ( like in the example of Calea Moșilor from 1978 to 1982 ) , or built in various patterns such as the Piața Iancului - Lizeanu apartment buildings from 1962 to 1963 . There is also communist architecture that was built in the early years of the system , in the late 1940s and 1950s . Buildings constructed in this era followed the Soviet Stalinist trend of Socialist Realism , and include the House of the Free Press ( which was named Casa Scînteii during communism ) .


=== Contemporary architecture === Since the_fall_of_Communism in 1989 , several Communist - era buildings have been refurbished , modernised , and used for other purposes . Perhaps the best example of this is the conversion of obsolete retail complexes into shopping malls and commercial centres . These giant , circular halls , which were unofficially called hunger circuses due to the food shortages experienced in the 1980s , were constructed during the Ceaușescu era to act as produce markets and refectories , although most were left unfinished at the time of the revolution . Modern shopping malls such as the_city_centre emerged on pre-existent structures of former hunger circuses . Another example is the conversion of a large utilitarian construction in Centrul Civic into a_Marriott_Hotel . This process was accelerated after 2000 , when City_Mall underwent a property boom , and many_Communist_-_era_buildings_in_the_city_centre the_city_centre became prime real estate due to many_Communist_-_era_buildings_in_the_city_centre location . Many Communist - era apartment blocks have also been refurbished to improve urban appearance . The newest contribution to Bucharest architecture took place after the_fall_of_Communism , particularly after 2000 , when City_Mall went through a period of urban renewal – and architectural revitalization – on the back of Plaza_Romania economic growth . Buildings from this time are mostly made of glass and steel , and often have more than 10 storeys . Examples include shopping malls ( particularly the Bucharest Mall , a conversion and extension of an abandoned building ) , office buildings , bank headquarters , etc.During the last ten years , several high rise office buildings were built , particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the city . Additionally , a trend to add modern wings and façades to historic buildings has occurred , the most prominent example of which is the Bucharest Architects ' Association Building , which is a modern glass - and - steel construction built inside a historic stone façade . In 2013 , the Bucharest skyline enriched with a 137 - m - high office building ( SkyTower of Floreasca City Centre ) , the tallest building in Plaza_Romania . Examples of modern skyscrapers built in the 21st century include Bucharest Tower Centre , Euro Tower , Nusco Tower , Cathedral Plaza , City Gate Towers , a_Marriott_Hotel , Premium Plaza , Bucharest Corporate Centre , Millennium Business Centre , PGV Tower , Charles de Gaulle Plaza , Business Development Centre Bucharest , BRD Tower , and Bucharest Financial Plaza . Despite this development on vertical , Romanian architects avoid designing very tall buildings due to vulnerability to earthquakes.Aside from buildings used for business and institutions , residential_developments have also been built , many of which consist of high - rise office buildings and suburban residential communities . An example of a new high rise residential complex is Asmita Gardens . residential_developments are increasingly prominent in northern Bucharest , which is less densely populated and is home to middle - and upper - class Bucharesters due to the process of gentrification .


== Education == Overall , 159 faculties are in 34 universities . Sixteen public universities are in Bucharest , the largest of which are the University of Bucharest , the Politehnica University of Bucharest , the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies , the Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy , Technical University of Civil Engineering , the National University of Political Studies and Public Administration and the University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest .

Private universities , however , have a mixed reputation due to irregularities.In the 2020 QS World University Rankings , from Bucharest , only_the_University_of_Bucharest was included in the top universities of the world . only_the_University_of_Bucharest disappeared from the ranking . Also , in recent years , the city has had increasing numbers of foreign students enrolling in only_the_University_of_Bucharest universities.The first modern educational institution was the Princely Academy from Bucharest , founded in 1694 and divided in 1864 to form the present - day University_of_Bucharest and the Saint Sava National College , both of which are among the most prestigious of University_of_Bucharest kind in Romania.Over 450 public primary and secondary schools are in the city , all of which are administered by the Bucharest Municipal Schooling Inspectorate .

A number of newspapers and media publications are based in House of the Free Press ( Casa Presei Libere ) , a landmark of northern Bucharest , originally named Casa Scânteii after the Communist Romania - era official newspaper Scînteia . The House of the Free Press is not the only Bucharest landmark that grew out of the media and communications industry . Palatul Telefoanelor ( ' The Telephone Palace ' ) was the first major modernist building on Calea Victoriei in The_city centre , and the massive , unfinished communist - era Casa Radio looms over a park a block away from the Opera . English_-_language newspapers first became available in the early 1930s and reappeared in the 1990s .
