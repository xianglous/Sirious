0,"the media plays an important role in developing our relationship with political change, mainly by ignoring politics and focusing on celebrities and scandals - but even when they do talk about important political issues, they do it in a way that discourages engagement - like a newspaper ad or a book review. The public space is a huge obstacle to any type of progressive political change, because it has a price tag on freedom of expression. People are more likely to want to read about a movie, watch a movie, etc","Often it is said people are too stupid, selfish, or lazy to care about local politics. Dave proposes the opposite view: that people do care but there are barriers put in their way to prevent action. These barriers are: 1. City Hall: 'community engagement' for a project may be by placing an ad in the local paper, but the ad is in tiny font with the details (what is proposed, how to object) hidden within a page full of pointless text. If people were supposed to be involved, the ad would have just a picture, large font next to it with the proposal, and contact details - similar to when a business advertises. When"
1,"in two weeks time, that's the ninth anniversary of the day he first stepped out onto that hallowed ""Jeopardy"" set. He was always fascinated with game shows and loved game shows. He studied computers and became a computer programmer when he was first on ""Jeopardy"" in 2004 - but not all people are still alive. When he gets recognized at the mall, he is known as a bit of a know-it-all. For better or for worse, he has a lot of trivia","Ken Jennings loved game shows from a young age, and felt extreme satisfaction when he beat his parents at Trivial Pursuit ""Knowledge is Power"". In 2004 he appeared on Jeopardy for the first time, but in 2009 he got a call from the producers asking him to play against IBM's Jeopardy machine: Watson. Because of his love of the game he agreed, but also because he knew about AI at the time and thought he could win. It is extremely difficult for computers to understand language and the nuance of natural communication, so Ken was confident. As the time came closer, he saw graphs of Watson's performance against"
2,"an 18-year-old, African-American male joined the United States Air Force and was assigned to Mountain Home Air Force Base. The first goal that he had was to identify an apartment, so he could bring his wife and baby, Melanie, out to join him in Idaho. He immediately went to personnel office, and talking with the guys in personnel, they said, ""Hey, no problem finding an apartment in Mountain Home, Idaho. The people down there love us because they know if they have an airman who is coming in to rent","53 years ago James was having significant problems renting a house. He was moving to a small town in Idaho with his family, to join the air force. He called ahead at a number of places, but when they saw he was black they suddenly had no vacancies. He eventually bought a trailer from another airman, but couldn't find a trailer park to park it at. In the 3 months before the Ferguson shooting (where a young black man was shot by police), 8 unarmed African-Americans had been shot to death by police or white home-owners. It seems that driving while black, talking while black, walking while black are dangerous. James' grandsons are stopped by police"
3,"the Internet is vulnerable to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen, or deliberate attacks, but even the mistakes can be bad. For example, in Asia recently, it was impossible to get YouTube because a single router card had a bug in it. The problem is that people don't want their name, address and telephone number published to everyone, and they depend on each other to do things. This is why there are so many bad guys on the Internet these days, and this makes it more difficult to make a book like this.","Danny was one of the first users of the internet - back in 1982 when everyone's email address and contact details were printed large print in a thin phone book. All users trusted each other, taking only what they needed (domain names) and passing messages on each other's behalf when bandwidth was low. He jokes that it is remarkable such communist ideals underwrote the US defense department's efforts during the cold war. Trust is much lower nowadays, and we are dealing with this by making smaller walled networks: VPNs and subnetworks - that imitate the internet on a smaller scale. The internet protocols are still vulnerable to attack and silly mistakes - for example Youtube was blocked in"
4,"'polar explorer' has spent more than two percent of his life living in a tent inside the Arctic Circle, so he gets out of the house a fair bit. The pithiest answer to the question ""why?"" that's been dogging him for the last 12 years was credited to this chap, the rakish-looking gentleman standing at the back, who may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest, more than 30 years before Edmund Hillary. He coined the phrase, ""Because it's there""","Ben was posed the question: with constant information supply nowadays - why bother leaving the house? He uses a quote from George Mallory - possibly the first man to reach the top of Everest (he died near the summit, with conflicting evidence about whether he had reached it or not). Ben relates his own experience on a solo arctic expedition, disagreeing with Mallory's quest for ""joy"", and instead saying he felt only terror before his own journey. However, in his 10 weeks he saw a shifting and unique arctic landscape that noone will see again. He cannot explain it to us, we'd need to be there ourselves. He also"
5,"NSA-style mass surveillance is enabling local police departments to gather vast quantities of sensitive information about each and every one of us in a way that was never previously possible. Location information can reveal if you go to a therapist, attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, or don't go to church. This information used to be private. But thanks to modern technology, the government knows far too much about what happens behind closed doors. The use of plate readers is not just limited to the United States, but also across the world.","Police are using military style weapons, and collecting NSA style data. Automatic license plate readers mounted on police cars or beside roads are letting local police track where people are at all times. If anyone passes a plate reader, their records are kept for years. When a citizen requested their records, they found a series of photos including one of their daughters inside his driveway. The cost of storing these photos is getting lower, so the photos tend to be kept for years. These plate readers can be abused with highly targetted tracking attempts. New York Police have driven past mosques to track attendance, and UK police have put a sketch artist on a watchlist after he drew attendees from a"
6,"Arthur Samuel was the father of machine learning, and he is a machine learning practitioner. he ran a project at Kaggle where a team from the University of Toronto won a competition for automatic drug discovery. they learned how to do this from data rather than being programmed by hand.","Traditional programming of a computer means telling it in absolute detail how to achieve a task. This is difficult unless the programmer is an expert in the task he is teaching, and prevents the computer being better than the programmer. Machine learning allows a computer to learn on it's own - as Arthur Samuel programmed a computer to beat himself at checkers. Nowadays machine learning has been successfully commercialised. Google is based on machine learning, LinkedIn and Facebook have learnt how to recommend friends, Amazon can recommend products using machine learning. Deep learning is an algorithm inspired by how the human brain works, so assuming enough computation time and learning time, there are no limits. For example, deep learning"
7,"the writer cautioned us that, among all forms of mistake, prophesy is the most gratuitous. Yogi Berra said: ""It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future."" The reason this is different is that just in the past few years, our machines have started demonstrating skills they have never had before: understanding, speaking, hearing, answering, writing, and we get freed up from drudgery and toil. This is the best economic news on the planet these days. We are seeing an amazing","Prophecy is hard, but it is easy to see that in the future there will be more things that sound like science fiction, and fewer jobs. Even in the near future drivers are being replaced with automated cars, something similar to Siri and Watson will take over customer service jobs, and automatic trolleys can automate warehouses. Replacing workers with technology has been happening for 200 years, but most people still had jobs. However, now machines are picking up skills they haven't had: to understand, speak, think. Jobs will be replaced with machines, but this is wonderful economic news for 2 reasons. 1. Technology is the reason that economies can grow, prices can come down, and quality continue to increase all"
8,"a new particle accelerator may destroy 90% of humanity, but it could be even worse than A scenario - and the body count is 10 percent higher than A. As an astronomer, he can't believe that humans are the end of the story - so post-human evolution will happen much faster on a technological timescale, not a natural selection timescale. We fret too much about minor hazards - air travel can spread pandemics worldwide within days, but politicians are in denial about catastrophic scenarios. The worst haven't yet.","The Earth has existed for 45 million centuries, but this is the first where threats to the Earth could conceivably come from humanity. The political will to deal with these catastrophic threats is weak - instead we focus on minor hazards such as plane crashes and chemicals in food. In the same way as we pay a premium for car insurance, doesn't it make sense to plan for these threats? It is likely that common people will have the capability to design biological organisms this century. These could be misused by people looking to do immense damage. Regulation cannot prevent misuse, since there will always be a country where anything is possible. People were concerned when the particle accelerator came online, but this has been done naturally many times."
9,"a game of Monopoly is rigged, and you've got the upper hand. You've got more money, more opportunities to move around the board, and more access to resources. So we ran a study on the UC Berkeley campus to look at how that experience might change the way you think about yourself and regard that other player. We watched through hidden cameras what happened over the course of 15 minutes. The rich player started to move around the board louder, literally smacking the board with the piece as he went around","Paul shows us footage of a psychological experiment - a rigged 2 player monopoly game where they randomly pick one player to be more wealthy. The wealthy player starts with more money, gets double the income for passing GO, and moves more often. As they inevitably started winning, they'd act more aggressive, eat more snacks, mock their opponent, keep talking about their money. After the game they were asked why they won - and they'd talk about their own actions & strategy, rather than reflecting on the advantages given at the start. The results from this can be extended to society as a whole - wealthier people are often less compassionate or empathetic, and more"
10,"MOOC: massive open online courses. Many organizations are offering these courses to students all over the world, in the millions, for free - anyone who has an Internet connection can access these great courses and get a credential at the end of it. The last big innovation in education was the printing press and textbooks. Everything else has changed around us. Education hasn't changed in the past 500 years. Even the infrastructure has to change. We need to go from lectures on the blackboard to online exercises, virtual laboratories and gamification.","Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are taking off, able to teach millions of people at a time using online interactive technologies. 155,000 people enrolled in edX's first MOOC, with 7,157 students passing. But in this course, Anant looks at what we can learn from MOOCs to apply in more conventional university courses. University lectures have not changed significantly in the last 50 years. Anant claims the last big leap in education was textbooks and the printing press, hundreds of years ago. Modern teenagers interact and learn very differently to how they learnt decades ago - they are more comfortable in the online world. Education needs to embrace technology to better engage students. 1."
11,"a man by the name of Captain William Swenson recently was awarded the congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on September 8, 2009. he had to rescue a sergeant who had received a gunshot to the neck, and one of the medevac medics had a GoPro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera. The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings, they are not instructions. They are emotions, they are not instructions. If you get the environment right, every single one of us has the capacity to do these things, it means we can fall asleep at night","Simon starts by discussing a medal of honour recipient - a military man who charged into fire to pull wounded soldiers into a helicopter. In the military we give medals to people willing to sacrifice themselves to help others. However, in business we give bonuses to people who sacrifice others to help ourselves. In talking to heroic soldiers about why they made a sacrifice for someone else, they all said that the other guy would have done the same thing - there is a deep trust in the military. It is hard to build this trust in the office environment. In humanity's ancient history, danger was everywhere and the tribe needed to trust each other to stay safe. In modern times, a business has dangers -"
12,"TED is used to thinking of the TED audience as a wonderful collection of intelligent, intellectual, worldly and innovative people in the world. However, many, if not most, of you are actually tying your shoes incorrectly. He says that it seems ludicrous. But he also has reason to believe that many, if not most, of you are actually tying your shoes incorrectly. This is the way that most of us were taught to tie our shoes correctly. It's simple: Pull the cords under the bows at the base","At 50 yrs old, Terry discovered he (and most people) have learned to tie their shoes wrong. If you pull on the laces at the base of the knot, the incorrect common knot will turn vertically along the shoe. This is a weaker form of the bow. The key is when turning around the loop, go the opposite way to normal. This will yield a stronger knot, and will make it align across the shoe. As Terry concludes, sometimes a small advantage sometime in life will yield extraordinary results."
13,"a video game controller, and a Wii Remote sit on top of the projector. This allows for an interactive whiteboard, but requires more hardware - it can see multiple dots in the screen, and then registers the location of the camera pixels to the projector pixels. It is also possible to have a 3D room with targets floating in it. Louis Castle's work has been downloaded over half a million times, so teachers and students around the world are already using this.","Researchers sometimes use vast resources to achieve their goal. Sometimes the best solution uses cheap, off-the-shelf products to do somethine similar. Johnny shows off some hacks taking advantage of the Wii-mote - a cheap game controller ($40) with its motion sensing capabilities and infra-red camera. 1. With the right software, and a cheap infra-red pen (can be built for $5), the Wii-mote's IR camera can simulate a digital white board (worth $3,000). This software has been downloaded half a million times. 2. By putting the Wii-mote's IR camera under"
14,"congestion is a pervasive phenomenon. It exists in basically all of the cities around the world, which is surprising when you think about it. The typical European cities have a dense urban core, good public transport mostly, but no road capacity. The emerging world cities have mixed land-use patterns, and are moving by itself. They're trying to figure out what people should do instead of rush hour car driving. This is an example of a complex social system which has the ability to self-organize. When you try to solve complex social problems","Congestion is a problem in all cities, regardless of how the city is designed. Whether European cities with a central core and few roads, or American cities with plenty of roads and an urban sprawl, all have congestion. As people investigate solutions, they boil down to discouraging people from driving during rush hour. When dealing with complex social problems, no one person can be responsible for it. The solution is to create the right framework and incentives and allow everyone to adapt to the new situation. Stockholm is mainly congested at bridges entering the city, so they implemented a small charge of 1-2 euro at these bottlenecks during peak hour. This reduced traffic by 20%, which reduced it below the threshold needed"
15,"the sun and all the stars in the universe run on fusion, and it would run for billions and billions of years. The problem is that two nuclei are positively charged, so they don't want to fuse. This is why fusion is so hard to do. He decided to get his bit to solve global warming and make fusion happen.","Fossil fuels are currently our major energy source, since they are convenient and cost effective. Michel suggest nuclear power - it is energy dense, reliably produces power, and creates no CO2. Fission is currently the most common type of nuclear power, but fusion would be safer since the radioactive waste is very short term and there is no risk of meltdown. The fuel could be extracted from the ocean, and power us for billions of years. Fusion is difficult to pull off - the 2 nucleii need to be thrown together so fast that they overcome their electrostatic repulsion, which can only be done at 150 million degrees. This heat is the limiting factor that makes"
16,"the Big Bang was an era in the early universe when everything we see in the night sky was condensed into an incredibly small, incredibly hot mass, and from it sprung everything we see. The afterglow of the Big Bang is almost completely uniform. It's now 2.7 degrees, but it's not exactly 2.7 degrees. They found evidence of gravitational waves from the fundamental era, which are invisible for all practical purposes. This shows us that our bubble is just one bubble in a larger, roiling pot of universal stuff.","If you look at the sky you see stars, but if you look further and further you see nothing. Beyond that nothingness is the afterglow of the Big Bang. This afterglow is nearly completely uniform at 2.7 degrees, but has cooled slightly in small patches (20 ppm). These tiny discontinuities are caused by Quantum Mechanical 'wiggles' during the Big Bang, that have been stretched across the universe. Before the Big Bang, our universe was extremely dense like a metal bell. On March 17 something new was discovered. Like a metal bell, this original universe could be 'rung' by quantum mechanics, then it could produce gravitational waves (like the sound from"
17,"the scariest thing that you've ever done is because NASA does the math - one in nine crashes during the first five shuttle launches, and even when you first flew in the shuttle back in 1995, the odds of a catastrophic event during the first five shuttle launches was one in nine. The astronauts are very conscious about all the things they have to do, and how much pressure they have to go through. They can't make it worse, but there is no problem so bad that you can't make it worse. When you ride the elevator up","Colonel Chris Hadfield starts his talk with a question for the audience. What is the scariest, most dangerous thing you've ever done and why did you do it? For Chris, it was going into space. The odds of crashing during the first shuttle launches were 1/9. When you wake up on launch day, you know that at the end of the day you'll either be floating or you'll be dead. After takeoff there's 8min and 40sec of intense, intense pressure, equivalent to someone pouring cement on you. And then you're weightless. For Chris it was worth the risk. At age 9, watching other people walk on the moon, he made the decision to"
18,"the media lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take. The system tracks the four significant fingers, and recognizes gestures such as ""take a picture"" and ""take a picture""","Pattie talked about the limitations of current computer technology - that it is impractical to Google a person or product every time you see it. Wearable technology can do this for you. She showed off an array of items that cost less than $350, including a camera, wearable projector, mirror, phone, and colourful caps on fingers. Using this, you can walk up to any wall and begin using a computer - with the camera tracking any gestures they make by recognising their fingernails. Even without a wall, you can project onto your hand - eg as a simple dialling pad for a phone. Pattie shows some examples"
19,"Apple, Martin Luther King and the Wright brothers all think, act and communicate the exact same way - from the inside out. This is why people buy what they do; they buy why they do it. It's easy to understand and everyone gets it. But this is not always clear. We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing. How do you explain when things don't go as we assume? Why is it that Apple is more innovative than all their competitors? What makes them different is that they have the same talent, consultants, media, etc.","What gives the great leaders their edge? Why were Martin Luther King, Wright Brothers, & Steve Jobs successful when others have access to similar resources and conditions? The thing these leaders have in common is summarised in the 'Golden Circle'. 1. What - every organisation should know this 2. How - some know this - their differentiating values, or intellectual property 3. Why - only the best know this - why their organisation exists beyond a profit The best organisations can explain and sell the 'why' first, and use this to inspire others. People don't buy what you do, but why you do it. Using Apple as an example, their sales statements starts with their ""why"

She was diagnosed with a brain disorder of her own, and watched it completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information. The two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another. This is because they process information differently, each of our hemispheres think about different things and care about different things. We are energy-beings connected to each other through the consciousness of our right hemisphere's left hemisphere's right hemisphere's left hemisphere's right hemisphere's","Note this talk is an animated story of Jill's experiences during a stroke - where one hemisphere of her brain was'switched off'. This summary cannot do the full talk justice - if it interests you, watch the full video. Jill Bolte Taylor starts by trying to work out what makes her brain different from her brother's - who is schizophrenic. She elaborates by bringing a real human brain to the stage - showing it is divided into 2 distinct halves, with minimal connection between the two. Each half functions differently: 1. Right Hemisphere is a parallel processor. It focusses on the current moment,"

We have an awful, awful reality right now: America is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world. He wants to introduce you to some of the people he cares about: your children.","Jamie Oliver, a British chef and TV personality, delivers a talk on the importance of food education. Jamie presents a series of health related statistics. ""Statistically, 2/3 of the people in this room are overweight or obese."" ""25% of deaths are caused by heart disease"" He talks about his experiences, visiting Huntington, West Virginia, the most obese town in the United States and shares the personal stories of a few of the people he met there.

Reaches 31 million kids, twice a day, 180 days a year 2. Serve"
22,"ad man, who speaks at TED Evil, has come to realise that what we create in advertising is perceived value, or subjective value, or intangible value of some kind. He says this is a good substitute for using up labor or limited resources in the creation of things. This is an example of a train which goes from London to Paris and knocks about 40 minutes off a three-and-half hour journey time. The point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things, but rather by giving you an insane sense of unwarranted self-confessment","The talk is focused around the value of intangibles, specifically from the perspective of advertising. He tells us that all value is subjective, BUT an intangible change can be just as satisfying as a physical change. Frederick the Great, of Prussia, wanted more the country to adopt potatoes as their primary crop. But people thought potatoes looked ugly, tasted weird, and farmers had no desire to grow them. Frederick realized the farmers would rather be jailed than forced to grow potatoes. So he took a new approach, and decided to re brand the potato - changing its perceived value. He declared that potatoes were only for the royal grew them in his garden, protected around the clock by his"
23,"working memory is a part of our consciousness that we are aware of at any given time of day. It allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge. It allows us to reach back into our long-term memory and pull some of it in as we need it. People with high working memory capacity tend to be good storytellers. They can solve and do well on standardized tests, however important that is. They also tend to have high levels of writing ability. They can also reason at high levels. The problem is that life comes at us very quickly.","Your ability to solve problems is limited to your 'working memory' capacity - to remember and think at the same time. The example was memorising 5 words and then doing maths problems, which most people failed. He gives some (very brief) hints on how to process things more accurately, and remember more - including visualising more, and practising the things we're learning."
24,"essentially, mathematics is the science of patterns, and we study it to learn how to think logically, critically and creatively. But too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated, and students often hear that they need it in an upcoming math class or on a future test. Let me give you a quick example with Fibonacci numbers. These numbers can be appreciated in many different ways. From the standpoint of calculation, they're as easy to understand as one plus one, two plus three gives us five, four plus five also gives us 10","Math should be taught for 3 reasons: 1. Calculation: to work out an answer 2. Application: to apply the method 3. Inspiration: for the fun, beautiful patterns and logical thinking behind it. Arthur argues Inspiration is underappreciated. He shows the beauty of Fibonacci numbers and how it ties to nature 1. number of petals on a flower tends to be Fibonacci number 2. patterns in numbers: sum of squares of a Fibonacci number equals another Fibonacci, and cumulative sum of all squares equals product of 2 consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Maths isn't just solving for 'x', it's also about figuring"
25,"NASA spent around 180 billion dollars to get to the moon - four percent of today's budget - but before the program ended, 24 men flew to the moon. Twelve walked on its surface, and they didn't bring much back - 841 pounds of old rocks and a new sense of the fragility of our common home. The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and airplane, penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis. Since 1970, no human beings have been back to the moon.","People, politicians & investors have recently been unwilling to back big technology challenges such as the moon landing. The problems people imagined would be solved by technology (including famine, disease), due to lack of political will and public support for large scale research. Some issues such as famine are no longer technology problems, with political corruption preventing the food being distributed fairly."
