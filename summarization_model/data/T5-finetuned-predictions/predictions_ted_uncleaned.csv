Public space is an important obstacle towards any type of progressive political change, because whoever has the most money gets the loudest voice, dominating the visual and mental environment. The media plays an important role in developing our relationship with political change, by ignoring politics and focusing on celebrities and scandals.","Often it is said people are too stupid, selfish, or lazy to care about local politics. Dave proposes the opposite view: that people do care but there are barriers put in their way to prevent action. These barriers are: 1. City Hall: âcommunity engagementâ for a project may be by placing an ad in the local paper, but the ad is in tiny font with the details (what is proposed, how to object) hidden within a page full of pointless text. If people were supposed to be involved, the ad would have just a picture, large font next to it with the proposal, and contact details â similar to when a business"

He was the kind of kid who was always bugging Mom and Dad with whatever great fact he had just read about â Haley's comet or giant squids or the size of the world's biggest pumpkin pieâ but now has a 10-year-old of his own who is exactly the same. He loved game shows, fascinated with game shows","Ken Jennings loved game shows from a young age, and felt extreme satisfaction when he beat his parents at Trivial Pursuit âKnowledge is Powerâ. In 2004 he appeared on Jeopardy for the first time, but in 2009 he got a call from the producers asking him to play against IBMâs Jeopardy machine: Watson. Because of his love of the game he agreed, but also because he knew about AI at the time and thought he could win. It is extremely difficult for computers to understand language and the nuance of natural communication, so Ken was confident. As the time came closer, he saw"

A student asked her how she rewired her brain: after years as a Russian translator how did she learn engineering when she previously struggled. She looked into the issue from a neuroscience perspective. The brain is in 2 different âmodesâ: a focussed or a diffused mode. In focussed mode you think tightly through familiar problems you have solved before. However, the diffuse thought is needed to search for new ideas â you canât solve problems, but it is needed to find the answer if you havenât seen"

It begins with something that we all know how to do, which is how to make toast. It begins with a clean sheet of paper, a felt marker, and without using any words, you begin to draw how to make toast. After two minutes, toast and happiness. Some drawings are very good, but some are not so good. They really suck, because you don't know what these drawings share","Asking people to draw how to make toast can reveal a lot. 1. Most people draw a flow chart: images (nodes) connected with arrows (links). We intuitively know how to break a drawing down in this way. 2. The details people go to can reveal more about them: whether the supply chain of bread, or engineers drawing the inner workings of a toaster 3. people from different countries see toasters differently (Americans draw an electric toaster, Europeans a fry pan, or some draw fire). 4. Number of nodes is usually around 5, and 5-13 is the best to describe the process. Fewer nodes are too simple, but more"

At the same time, BPâs CEO convinced themselves that the Gulf of Mexico was big enough to absorb the pollution without problem.

6,"sliced bread was invented in the 1910s, but for the first 15 years after it was available no one bought it; no one knew about it; it was a complete and total failure. The success of sliced bread is not always about what the patent is like, or what the factory is like, but about can you get your idea to spread, or not. It doesn't matter whether you're running a coffee shop or an intellectual, or you're flying hot air balloons. And that people who can spread ideas, regardless of what those ideas","For the first few years, the idea of sliced bread was a complete flop â noone wanted it, and noone knew it was available. The original focus was on patents and factories â the technical side of the idea, rather than the commercial. Nowadays it doesnât matter how good your idea (or product) is, it is only the most widely spread that âwinâ. In recent history, the TV-Industrial complex was how companies spread their products. Advertising on TV would give you sales which you could reinvest in TV. Nowadays it just doesnât work â people have too many choices and too little time to care about"
7,"Arthur Samuel was the father of machine learning, and he has a great debt to him as a machine learning practitioner. He is the president of Kaggle, a community of over 200,000 machine learning practitioners. The first big success of machine learning commercially was Google. Google showed that it is possible to find information by using a computer algorithm. Companies like Amazon and Netflix use machine learning to suggest products that you might like to buy, movies that you might like to watch. IBM was successful in getting Watson to beat the two world champions at ""Jeopardy""","Traditional programming of a computer means telling it in absolute detail how to achieve a task. This is difficult unless the programmer is an expert in the task he is teaching, and prevents the computer being better than the programmer. Machine learning allows a computer to learn on itâs own â as Arthur Samuel programmed a computer to beat himself at checkers. Nowadays machine learning has been successfully commercialised. Google is based on machine learning, LinkedIn and Facebook have learnt how to recommend friends, Amazon can recommend products using machine learning. Deep learning is an algorithm inspired by how the human brain works, so assuming enough computation time and learning time, there are no limits. For example"

That was the most frequent response that we received.","People perceive the world differently. A softball player sees the ball as tiny compared to one on a good streak, and a dieter sees an apple as bigger than it is. In political views, people looked at a picture of Obama that had been artificially lightened or darkened, and asked which looked closer to reality. His supporters preferred the lightened picture, while opponents thought the dark picture was closer to reality. Why is this? Our eyes actually see very little. The amount of vision actually in clear focus is the size of our thumb at arms length. The rest is ambiguous, and filled in by our mind. So peopleâs perceptions are different, but what influences people to"

The rich player started to move around the board louder, literally smacking the board with the piece as he went around. They were more likely to see signs of dominance and nonverbal signs, displays of power and celebration among the poor players.","Paul shows us footage of a psychological experiment â a rigged 2 player monopoly game where they randomly pick one player to be more wealthy. The wealthy player starts with more money, gets double the income for passing GO, and moves more often. As they inevitably started winning, theyâd act more aggressive, eat more snacks, mock their opponent, keep talking about their money. After the game they were asked why they won â and theyâd talk about their own actions & strategy, rather than reflecting on the advantages given at the start.
