The media plays an important role in developing our relationship with political change, mainly by ignoring politics and focusing on celebrities and scandals.","Often it is said people are too stupid, selfish, or lazy to care about local politics. Dave proposes the opposite view: that people do care but there are barriers put in their way to prevent action. These barriers are: 1. City Hall: 'community engagement' for a project may be by placing an ad in the local paper, but the ad is in tiny font with the details (what is proposed, how to object) hidden within a page full of pointless text. If people were supposed to be involved, the ad would have just a picture, large font next to it with the proposal, and contact details - similar to when a business advertises. When"
1,"in two weeks time, that's the ninth anniversary of the day he first stepped out onto that hallowed ""Jeopardy"" set. He had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet, although it is not a hit with girls to know Captain Kirk's middle name. He loved game shows, fascinated with game shows and was always bugging Mom and Dad with whatever great fact he had just read about - Haley's comet or giant squids or the size of the world's biggest pumpkin pie or something.","Ken Jennings loved game shows from a young age, and felt extreme satisfaction when he beat his parents at Trivial Pursuit ""Knowledge is Power"". In 2004 he appeared on Jeopardy for the first time, but in 2009 he got a call from the producers asking him to play against IBM's Jeopardy machine: Watson. Because of his love of the game he agreed, but also because he knew about AI at the time and thought he could win. It is extremely difficult for computers to understand language and the nuance of natural communication, so Ken was confident. As the time came closer, he saw graphs of Watson's performance against"
2,"an 18-year-old, African-American male joined the United States Air Force and was assigned to Mountain Home Air Force Base and was a part of the air police squadron. He wanted to find an apartment, so his wife and new baby could join him in Idaho. When he arrived there, he asked for a list of people that can call, and then they will allow you to select the apartment that you want. The lady who answered said, ""Do you want a one-bedroom or two-bedroom?"" She said, ""You mean he rented those apartments","53 years ago James was having significant problems renting a house. He was moving to a small town in Idaho with his family, to join the air force. He called ahead at a number of places, but when they saw he was black they suddenly had no vacancies. He eventually bought a trailer from another airman, but couldn't find a trailer park to park it at. In the 3 months before the Ferguson shooting (where a young black man was shot by police), 8 unarmed African-Americans had been shot to death by police or white home-owners. It seems that driving while black, talking while black, walking while black are dangerous. James' grandsons are stopped by police"
3,"a directory of everybody who had an email address in 1982. It's deceptively large, with only about 20 people on each page, because it's sorted once by name and once by email address. There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then. They didn't know each other, but they trusted each other to do things. The idea of taking what you need was built into the protocols of the Internet itself. This principle was developed during the Cold War, and has been so successful that there are now more than 100 million people use the internet today.","Danny was one of the first users of the internet - back in 1982 when everyone's email address and contact details were printed large print in a thin phone book. All users trusted each other, taking only what they needed (domain names) and passing messages on each other's behalf when bandwidth was low. He jokes that it is remarkable such communist ideals underwrote the US defense department's efforts during the cold war. Trust is much lower nowadays, and we are dealing with this by making smaller walled networks: VPNs and subnetworks - that imitate the internet on a smaller scale. The internet protocols are still vulnerable to attack and silly mistakes - for example Youtube was blocked in"
4,"polar explorer is usually introduced as a doer of things more than a spectator or contemplator of things, so he gets out of the house a fair bit. The pithiest answer to the question ""why?"" that's been dogging him for the last 12 years was credited to this chap, the rakish-looking gentleman standing at the back, who may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest, more than 30 years before Edmund Hillary. He coined the phrase, ""Because it's there""","Ben was posed the question: with constant information supply nowadays - why bother leaving the house? He uses a quote from George Mallory - possibly the first man to reach the top of Everest (he died near the summit, with conflicting evidence about whether he had reached it or not). Ben relates his own experience on a solo arctic expedition, disagreeing with Mallory's quest for ""joy"", and instead saying he felt only terror before his own journey. However, in his 10 weeks he saw a shifting and unique arctic landscape that noone will see again. He cannot explain it to us, we'd need to be there ourselves. He also"
5,"NSA-style mass surveillance is enabling local police departments to gather vast quantities of sensitive information about each and every one of us in a way that was never previously possible. Location information can reveal how private citizens interact behind closed doors. With modern technology, the government knows far too much about what happens behind closed doors. Automatic License Plate Readers capture images of every passing car and convert them into machine-readable text so they can be checked against hot lists of cars potentially wanted for wrongdoing.","Police are using military style weapons, and collecting NSA style data. Automatic license plate readers mounted on police cars or beside roads are letting local police track where people are at all times. If anyone passes a plate reader, their records are kept for years. When a citizen requested their records, they found a series of photos including one of their daughters inside his driveway. The cost of storing these photos is getting lower, so the photos tend to be kept for years. These plate readers can be abused with highly targetted tracking attempts. New York Police have driven past mosques to track attendance, and UK police have put a sketch artist on a watchlist after he drew attendees from a"
6,"Arthur Samuel was the father of machine learning, and he has a great debt to him because he is a machine learning practitioner. in 1956, he wanted this computer to be able to beat him at checkers, and learn how to play checkers thousands of times. by 1962, this computer had beaten the Connecticut state champion.","Traditional programming of a computer means telling it in absolute detail how to achieve a task. This is difficult unless the programmer is an expert in the task he is teaching, and prevents the computer being better than the programmer. Machine learning allows a computer to learn on it's own - as Arthur Samuel programmed a computer to beat himself at checkers. Nowadays machine learning has been successfully commercialised. Google is based on machine learning, LinkedIn and Facebook have learnt how to recommend friends, Amazon can recommend products using machine learning. Deep learning is an algorithm inspired by how the human brain works, so assuming enough computation time and learning time, there are no limits. For example, deep learning"
7,"the writer cautioned us that, among all forms of mistake, prophesy is the most gratuitous. Yogi Berra said: ""It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future."" We are going to see more and more things that look like science fiction, and fewer and fewer jobs. Our cars are going to start driving themselves, which means we need fewer truck drivers. We will hook Siri up to Watson and automate a lot of the work that's currently done by customer service rep","Prophecy is hard, but it is easy to see that in the future there will be more things that sound like science fiction, and fewer jobs. Even in the near future drivers are being replaced with automated cars, something similar to Siri and Watson will take over customer service jobs, and automatic trolleys can automate warehouses. Replacing workers with technology has been happening for 200 years, but most people still had jobs. However, now machines are picking up skills they haven't had: to understand, speak, think. Jobs will be replaced with machines, but this is wonderful economic news for 2 reasons. 1. Technology is the reason that economies can grow, prices can come down, and quality continue to increase all"
8,"a decade ago, Freeman Dyson wrote a book which he called ""Our Final Century?"" The theme was this: Our Earth has existed for 45 million centuries, but this one is special - it's the first where one species, ours, has the planet's future in its hands. We fret too much about minor hazards - improbable air crashes, carcinogens in food, low radiation doses, and social media can spread panic and rumor literally at the speed of light. As science offers greater power and promise, millions will have the ability to misuse rapidly advancing biotechnololololololololol","The Earth has existed for 45 million centuries, but this is the first where threats to the Earth could conceivably come from humanity. The political will to deal with these catastrophic threats is weak - instead we focus on minor hazards such as plane crashes and chemicals in food. In the same way as we pay a premium for car insurance, doesn't it make sense to plan for these threats? It is likely that common people will have the capability to design biological organisms this century. These could be misused by people looking to do immense damage. Regulation cannot prevent misuse, since there will always be a country where anything is possible. People were concerned when the particle accelerator came online, but this has been done naturally many times."
9,"a study on the UC Berkeley campus looked at what happened in a game of Monopoly, and how it changed the way you think about yourself and regard that other player. The rich player started to move around the board louder, literally smacking the board with the piece as he went around. They were more likely to see signs of dominance and nonverbal signs, displays of power and celebration among the poor players.","Paul shows us footage of a psychological experiment - a rigged 2 player monopoly game where they randomly pick one player to be more wealthy. The wealthy player starts with more money, gets double the income for passing GO, and moves more often. As they inevitably started winning, they'd act more aggressive, eat more snacks, mock their opponent, keep talking about their money. After the game they were asked why they won - and they'd talk about their own actions & strategy, rather than reflecting on the advantages given at the start. The results from this can be extended to society as a whole - wealthier people are often less compassionate or empathetic, and more"
10,"the last year has seen the invention of a new four-letter word. MOOCs are massive open online courses that can be used by anyone with an Internet connection and the will to learn. They are taking what we are learning and the technologies we are developing in the large and applying them in the small to create a blended model of education. Education really hasn't changed in the past 500 years. The last big innovation in education was the printing press and the textbooks. Everything else has changed around us, but education hasn't changed.","Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are taking off, able to teach millions of people at a time using online interactive technologies. 155,000 people enrolled in edX's first MOOC, with 7,157 students passing. But in this course, Anant looks at what we can learn from MOOCs to apply in more conventional university courses. University lectures have not changed significantly in the last 50 years. Anant claims the last big leap in education was textbooks and the printing press, hundreds of years ago. Modern teenagers interact and learn very differently to how they learnt decades ago - they are more comfortable in the online world. Education needs to embrace technology to better engage students. 1."
11,"a man by the name of Captain William Swenson was awarded the congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on September 8, 2009. one of the people he rescued was a sergeant, and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter. He asked himself, where do people like this come from? The answer is that they're just better people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain. In business, we give bonuses to people willing to sacrifice others so that others may gain.","Simon starts by discussing a medal of honour recipient - a military man who charged into fire to pull wounded soldiers into a helicopter. In the military we give medals to people willing to sacrifice themselves to help others. However, in business we give bonuses to people who sacrifice others to help ourselves. In talking to heroic soldiers about why they made a sacrifice for someone else, they all said that the other guy would have done the same thing - there is a deep trust in the military. It is hard to build this trust in the office environment. In humanity's ancient history, danger was everywhere and the tribe needed to trust each other to stay safe. In modern times, a business has dangers -"
12,"tying your shoes incorrectly is the way most of us were taught to tie our shoes - but not so - let's demonstrate. There are two forms of this knot: strong form and weak form, and we were taught the weak form. The stronger form will come untied less often. It will let you down less, and looks better.","At 50 yrs old, Terry discovered he (and most people) have learned to tie their shoes wrong. If you pull on the laces at the base of the knot, the incorrect common knot will turn vertically along the shoe. This is a weaker form of the bow. The key is when turning around the loop, go the opposite way to normal. This will yield a stronger knot, and will make it align across the shoe. As Terry concludes, sometimes a small advantage sometime in life will yield extraordinary results."
13,"a tiny fraction of the world can actually participate in this exploration or benefit from that technology. This motivates me, and gets me really excited about my research, is when I see simple opportunities to drastically change that distribution and make the technology accessible to a much wider percentage of the population. The Nintendo Wii Remote is a $40 video game controller with motion-sensing capabilities. It's mostly advertised for its motion-sensing capabilities: swing a tennis racket, or hit a baseball bat. In the tip of each controller is an infrared pen.","Researchers sometimes use vast resources to achieve their goal. Sometimes the best solution uses cheap, off-the-shelf products to do somethine similar. Johnny shows off some hacks taking advantage of the Wii-mote - a cheap game controller ($40) with its motion sensing capabilities and infra-red camera. 1. With the right software, and a cheap infra-red pen (can be built for $5), the Wii-mote's IR camera can simulate a digital white board (worth $3,000). This software has been downloaded half a million times. 2. By putting the Wii-mote's IR camera under"
14,"road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon. It exists in basically all of the cities around the world, which is surprising when you think about it. Think about how different cities are: typical European cities have a dense urban core, good public transportation mostly, but not much capacity. The emerging world cities have mixed variety of vehicles and land-use patterns, but nothing seems to work. They try to figure out what people should do instead of rush hour car driving. This is an example of a complex social system which has the ability of self-organizing.","Congestion is a problem in all cities, regardless of how the city is designed. Whether European cities with a central core and few roads, or American cities with plenty of roads and an urban sprawl, all have congestion. As people investigate solutions, they boil down to discouraging people from driving during rush hour. When dealing with complex social problems, no one person can be responsible for it. The solution is to create the right framework and incentives and allow everyone to adapt to the new situation. Stockholm is mainly congested at bridges entering the city, so they implemented a small charge of 1-2 euro at these bottlenecks during peak hour. This reduced traffic by 20%, which reduced it below the threshold needed"
15,"nuclear energy is very energy-dense, it produces solid, reliable power, and doesn't make any CO2. There are two ways of making nuclear energy: fission and fusion. This is nature's way of producing energy. If the whole planet would run on fusion, we could extract the fuel from the ocean for about one thousandth of a cent per kilowatt-hour. It would run for billions and billions of years. The problem is, they are both positively charged, so they don't want to fuse.","Fossil fuels are currently our major energy source, since they are convenient and cost effective. Michel suggest nuclear power - it is energy dense, reliably produces power, and creates no CO2. Fission is currently the most common type of nuclear power, but fusion would be safer since the radioactive waste is very short term and there is no risk of meltdown. The fuel could be extracted from the ocean, and power us for billions of years. Fusion is difficult to pull off - the 2 nucleii need to be thrown together so fast that they overcome their electrostatic repulsion, which can only be done at 150 million degrees. This heat is the limiting factor that makes"
16,"the Big Bang was an era in the early universe when everything we see in the night sky was condensed into an incredibly small, incredibly hot, incredibly roiling mass, and from it sprung everything we see. Now it's been 14 billion years since that Big Bang, and so it's almost completely uniform. It's now 2.7 degrees, but it's not exactly 2.7 degrees. This is spectacular, and what they found on Monday is cooler. Imagine you take a bell with a whack","If you look at the sky you see stars, but if you look further and further you see nothing. Beyond that nothingness is the afterglow of the Big Bang. This afterglow is nearly completely uniform at 2.7 degrees, but has cooled slightly in small patches (20 ppm). These tiny discontinuities are caused by Quantum Mechanical 'wiggles' during the Big Bang, that have been stretched across the universe. Before the Big Bang, our universe was extremely dense like a metal bell. On March 17 something new was discovered. Like a metal bell, this original universe could be 'rung' by quantum mechanics, then it could produce gravitational waves (like the sound from"

You look back to the first five shuttle launches, the odds of a catastrophic event during the first five shuttle launches was one in nine. And even when you first flew in the shuttle back in 1995, the odds were still one in 38 or so - one in 35, one in 40. The most dangerous thing you've ever done is to get into the suit-up room at the Kennedy Space Center and ride","Colonel Chris Hadfield starts his talk with a question for the audience. What is the scariest, most dangerous thing you've ever done and why did you do it? For Chris, it was going into space. The odds of crashing during the first shuttle launches were 1/9. When you wake up on launch day, you know that at the end of the day you'll either be floating or you'll be dead. After takeoff there's 8min and 40sec of intense, intense pressure, equivalent to someone pouring cement on you. And then you're weightless. For Chris it was worth the risk. At age 9, watching other people walk on the moon, he made the decision to"
18,"the media lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take. The latest effort is wearing a camera, just a simple web cam, a portable, battery-powered projection system with a little mirror. This allows him to walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him. It tracks the four significant fingers on the screen.","Pattie talked about the limitations of current computer technology - that it is impractical to Google a person or product every time you see it. Wearable technology can do this for you. She showed off an array of items that cost less than $350, including a camera, wearable projector, mirror, phone, and colourful caps on fingers. Using this, you can walk up to any wall and begin using a computer - with the camera tracking any gestures they make by recognising their fingernails. Even without a wall, you can project onto your hand - eg as a simple dialling pad for a phone. Pattie shows some examples"
19,"Apple is more innovative than all competition, but they have the same talent, agencies, consultants and media. Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement, and he was not the only one who suffered in pre-civil rights America. The Wright brothers were able to figure out powered man flight when there were other teams better qualified, better funded - and they beat them to it. This discovery profoundly changed his view on how the world worked, and the way in which he operates in it. It's the exact opposite to everyone else.","What gives the great leaders their edge? Why were Martin Luther King, Wright Brothers, & Steve Jobs successful when others have access to similar resources and conditions? The thing these leaders have in common is summarised in the 'Golden Circle'. 1. What - every organisation should know this 2. How - some know this - their differentiating values, or intellectual property 3. Why - only the best know this - why their organisation exists beyond a profit The best organisations can explain and sell the 'why' first, and use this to inspire others. People don't buy what you do, but why you do it. Using Apple as an example, their sales statements starts with their ""why"

The morning of the hemorrhage, she could not walk, talk, read, write or recall any of her life. She was diagnosed with a brain disorder of her own, and had to live as an infant in a woman's body. When you look at the brain, it's completely separate from one another. This is the front of the brain, the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging","Note this talk is an animated story of Jill's experiences during a stroke - where one hemisphere of her brain was'switched off'. This summary cannot do the full talk justice - if it interests you, watch the full video. Jill Bolte Taylor starts by trying to work out what makes her brain different from her brother's - who is schizophrenic. She elaborates by bringing a real human brain to the stage - showing it is divided into 2 distinct halves, with minimal connection between the two. Each half functions differently: 1. Right Hemisphere is a parallel processor. It focusses on the current moment,"

22,"a train from London to Paris was given to engineers 15 years ago, asking how do we make the journey better? The engineers came up with a solution: build completely new tracks from London to the coast, knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half hour journey time. This is an unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter. Employ all of the world's top male and female supermodels, pay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus for the entire duration","The talk is focused around the value of intangibles, specifically from the perspective of advertising. He tells us that all value is subjective, BUT an intangible change can be just as satisfying as a physical change. Frederick the Great, of Prussia, wanted more the country to adopt potatoes as their primary crop. But people thought potatoes looked ugly, tasted weird, and farmers had no desire to grow them. Frederick realized the farmers would rather be jailed than forced to grow potatoes. So he took a new approach, and decided to re brand the potato - changing its perceived value. He declared that potatoes were only for the royal grew them in his garden, protected around the clock by his"
23,"working memory allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge. It allows us to reach back into our long-term memory and pull some of that in as we need it, mixes it, processes it in light of whatever our current goal is. People with high working memory capacity tend to be good storytellers. They solve and do well on standardized tests, however important that is. They are also able to reason at high levels. Working memory has a fairly long history, and it's associated with a lot of positive","Your ability to solve problems is limited to your 'working memory' capacity - to remember and think at the same time. The example was memorising 5 words and then doing maths problems, which most people failed. He gives some (very brief) hints on how to process things more accurately, and remember more - including visualising more, and practising the things we're learning."
24,"a number called Fibonacci can be understood in many different ways. From the standpoint of calculation, they're as easy to understand as one plus one, which is three, two plus three is five, three plus five is eight, and so on. In terms of applications, Fibonacci numbers appear in nature surprisingly often. The number of petals on a flower is typically a Fibonacci number, or the number of spirals on a sunflower or pineapple tends to be a Fibonacci number.","Math should be taught for 3 reasons: 1. Calculation: to work out an answer 2. Application: to apply the method 3. Inspiration: for the fun, beautiful patterns and logical thinking behind it. Arthur argues Inspiration is underappreciated. He shows the beauty of Fibonacci numbers and how it ties to nature 1. number of petals on a flower tends to be Fibonacci number 2. patterns in numbers: sum of squares of a Fibonacci number equals another Fibonacci, and cumulative sum of all squares equals product of 2 consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Maths isn't just solving for 'x', it's also about figuring"
25,"the Apollo program was the greatest peacetime mobilization in the history of the United States. to get to the moon, NASA spent around 180 billion dollars in today's money, or four percent of the federal budget. To get there, NASA employed around 400,000 people and demanded the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies. Before the Apollo program ended, 24 men flew to the moon. Twelve walked on its surface. They didn't bring much back: 841 pounds of old rocks and a new sense of the smallness and fragility of our common home.","People, politicians & investors have recently been unwilling to back big technology challenges such as the moon landing. The problems people imagined would be solved by technology (including famine, disease), due to lack of political will and public support for large scale research. Some issues such as famine are no longer technology problems, with political corruption preventing the food being distributed fairly."
