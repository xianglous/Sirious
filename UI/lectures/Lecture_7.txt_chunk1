Wow, what an audience but if I'm being honest, I don't care what you think of my talk. I don't care what the internet thinks. My talk. They're the ones who get it seen and get a shirt and I think that's where most people get it wrong. You're talking to you here. Instead of talking to you random person, scrolling Facebook. Thanks for the click back in 2009. We all had these weird little things called attention spans. Yeah, I'm trying to think of the last time I watched an 18 minutes had talked in years, literally years. So, if you're giving a TED Talk, keep it quick. I'm doing mine and under a minute. I'm at 44 seconds right now. That means you got time for one final joke, why are balloons so expensive? Inflation.
